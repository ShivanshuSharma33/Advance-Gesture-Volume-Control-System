# Advance-Gesture-Volume-Control-System


This project uses MediaPipe framework for Hand Landmark Detection that detects hand first and identify 14 landmarks on the hand. I have used specific landmarks by using openCV and pycaw library of python to control the volume of system by hand gestures. 


<h3>Steps:</h3></br>

1.Create a Hand Detection Module that detects hand and draw 14 landmarks on the hand using openCV.</br>
2.Create a GestureVolumeControl.py file that will call Hand Detection Module and pycaw library of python to control the volume of system by hand gestures.</br>
